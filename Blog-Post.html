               <h1>Post 01 about Halkidiki</h1>
                <span class="postDate">17 June 2021, by <a href="#">Kalogerogiannis</a> </span>
                <p id="introduction">Shaped like Poseidon’s trident, Halkidiki’s prongs jut out into the Aegean Sea. Lush green forests extend all the way to the beachfront where reflections of golden sunlight add sparkling hues to turquoise waters. Long stretches of beautiful ever-changing shoreline, unique archaeological sites, world-renowned Christian monuments, lesser-known natural wonders and man-made masterpieces have all helped shape the region’s diverse identity, made even more interesting by the rich local culinary and cultural heritage.</p>

                <h2 id="sub-heading">A breathtaking combination of blue and green</h2>
